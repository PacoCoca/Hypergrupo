Scenario 1:
Alessio is a family father looking for some help for his son. After a lot of researching he finally found "Children's Hope", our webpage.
Since he is used to use the new technologies, it wasn't difficult for him to navigate on our page.
When he entered in the homepage, he noticed that it was worth it for his son, after he went deeper into the subject looking at the page "Who We Are". 
Finally he found several interesting events close to his home in order to help his son, and he contacted with the organization through the "Contact Us" page.
